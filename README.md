# SASHIMI
SASHIMI (Spatial Analysis for Segmented Histopathology Images using Machine Intelligence) is a tool for capturing spatial cell-cell interactions in histopathology image using spatial summary statistics.

## Description
**SASHIMI** is a computational framework designed to extract quantitative, statistically robust summaries of cell-cell interactions within the Tumor Microenvironment (TME). Leveraging spatial statistics and point pattern analysis, SASHIMI translates raw cell coordinate data from histopathological images into meaningful scalar descriptors that characterize tissue organization and cellular architecture.

## Dependencies
This program requires the use of following R packages. 

```{r}
library(spatstat)
library(dispRity)
library(spdep)
```
